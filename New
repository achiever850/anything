Data Loading Documentation for Main and External APIs
1. Loading Main APIs
1.1 Jobs Overview
Job 1: Redshift_main_tables_api

Purpose: Load data from APIs with less than 4 million records.
Resource: Use G1X for cost efficiency.
Job 2: Redshift_main_tables_bulk_load_data

Purpose: Load data from APIs with large volumes of records.
Resource: Use G2X for higher memory capacity.
Recovery: If the job times out or is interrupted, resume loading from the last completed page instead of starting over.
1.2 Job Execution Guidelines
Before running either job, adjust the table number and batch size according to the requirements.
API response times are generally faster during evenings and weekends.
1.3 Logging
Monitor output logs in the Glue job for:
Total number of pages processed
Total records loaded
References to specific screen shorts
1.4 Data Synchronization
For APIs with high volumes, refresh the Redshift table frequently to keep it in sync with the API data.
2. Loading External ID APIs
2.1 Process Overview
Use two Python scripts to load data into CSV files, which are then stored in an S3 bucket before being imported into Redshift.
2.2 Steps for Data Loading
Run step2_expand.py

Initial Execution: Start from page -1 for the first run.
If the job stops, note the last successfully loaded page and resume from a lower page number (e.g., if the last loaded page is 1500, resume from 1450 or 1470).
This method helps avoid missing pages and minimizes duplicate records, which can be handled later.
Key Adjustments:

For loading external IDs, change the key value, table name, and expand URL in both Python files before execution.
Rejection Handling

Track rejection records in a separate folder.
Use step2_expand_rejections.py to process these rejection records.
When rerunning this script, adjust the file name to target new rejection records.
2.3 Important Considerations
While processing rejection records, some may succeed upon reprocessing. Ensure all rejections are saved and processed accordingly.
3. Onboarding Tasks
As discussed, I have successfully extracted data for the onboarding tasks for the first time. I have shared the completed onboarding task folder at the specified path. Please check and run all the rejection records using the step2_expand_rejections.py file as we discussed.

3.1 Current Status
All main APIs have been successfully loaded. However, for external IDs, the following onboarding tasks need to be rerun:

Onboarding Tasks
Customers
Requests
This is necessary because all headers have changed for a few files.

3.2 Common Errors
While running external IDs, the most frequent errors observed are due to changing table columns each time the API is rerun. If you encounter these errors, ensure that:

The external IDs table columns in the USA staffing page,
The external ID mapping schema,
The Redshift table DDLs
must all be consistent.

To troubleshoot this error:

Run the external ID API in the command prompt and check pages one by one using api_data['data'][26].
Repeat this process until you identify the page that contains all the expected external IDs and columns, as some pages may not populate data for certain external IDs.
4. Conclusion
This document outlines the procedures for loading data from both main and external APIs into Redshift. Adhering to these guidelines will help maintain data integrity and optimize the loading process.



Subject: Documentation and Status Update for Main and External IDs APIs

Hello Shahzad,

I'm sharing the documentation for loading data for main and external IDs APIs.

Status Update:

Main APIs: Successfully completed and loaded into Redshift.
External IDs: All APIs are loaded except for "Customers." I have also completed the onboarding tasks and "Requests" previously, but these need to be rerun due to bad data from the source.
All files are saved in the prakash_share folder as we discussed yesterday. Please find the file paths below.

Best regards,
[Your Name]


As discussed, Iâ€™ve completed the initial load for the onboarding tasks, and the onboarding task folder has been placed in both specified folders. Below is a summary of the current status and loading
